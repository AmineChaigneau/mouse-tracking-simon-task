# Mouse Tracking Simon Task React Application

## Introduction
The Mouse Tracking Simon Task is an interactive web application designed to measure and analyze cognitive responses to numerical stimuli using the principles established by Scherbaum and Kieslich. It provides an engaging way to study the Simon effect and congruency sequence effect through a React-based interface.

The Mouse Tracking Simon Task is currently hosted and available for testing at the following link: [Simon Task Application](https://simontask2023a1b2.web.app/)

## Procedure
Participants undergo a series of trials where they must make decisions based on the numerical value of stimuli. They are instructed to choose the left option for numbers less than 5 and the right for numbers greater than 5, regardless of the stimulus's spatial position on the screen.

## Design
Our application incorporates a detailed experimental design that allows for the manipulation of independent variables such as directional implication and spatial presentation. It follows a rigorous procedure to present 256 trials that alternate between conflict and non-conflict conditions.

## Mouse-Tracking
Mouse movements are meticulously recorded to analyze the participant's decision-making process. The application is calibrated to track the dynamics of mouse kinematics, providing insights into cognitive patterns during the task.

## Calibration and Training Session
Before the main experiment, participants can familiarize themselves with the interface through a training session that includes 40 trials. This helps to establish a baseline for individual response strategies.

## Installation
To set up the application locally, please follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link/mouse-tracking-simon-task
cd mouse-tracking-simon-task
npm install
```
## Usage
```bash
npm start
```
Follow the on-screen instructions for calibration and proceed with the main task as prompted.
